now time to create to some other pages as well for the website now we will create about, team and contact pages i have given the reference of the pages from the other website in a seperate forlder called reference in the main directory check the pages they are absolutely phenomenal and very good i want you to make the pages for this website as well so take the reference and make the pages for this website
remember those pages are just for the reference dont just copy paste them this website's theme and context should be intact its just for taking reference remember it i want you to create them for this websites verion

do not create event page currently and use dummy data for now on team page also dont touch anything in the landing page its already good

go


the images that you have used in the about page are not good i want you to change them you can generate images on your own that will be best fitting
